<h3 >RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h3>
      			<ol id="para"><li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
      				<li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
      				<li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
      				<li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
      			</ol>
<h4>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</h4>
      			<p id="para">To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.</p>
      			<p id="para">Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.</p>
      			<p id="para">After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.</p>
      			<p id="para">You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</p>
      			<p id="para">If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.</p>
